Practice Design Patterns through implementing a text based adventure game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This collaborative project aims at getting a feel for design patterns and what 
problems they try to solve.

If you're interested in joining us on this adventure, you can find us at
https://codebuddies.org/ (we're in the Python channel in Slack).

### Instructions

Your task is to implement the `MyCharacter` class found in 
text_adventure/entity.py. The `update` method contains print statements
explaining how the character should behave.

You can find an example of what the output might be like in 
`expected_output.txt`.
