Practice Design Patterns through implementing a text based adventure game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This collaborative project aims at getting a feel for design patterns and what 
problems they try to solve.

If you're interested in joining us on this adventure, you can find us at

### Instructions

#### First assignment

Fork the code. Create a new branch. Make your changes in your own repo.
Commit your changes. Once you're happy with your code, create a pull request.

Your task is to implement the `MyCharacter` class found in 
text_adventure/entity.py. The `update` method contains print statements
explaining how the character should behave, and Workflow.png will give you
some hints on what order things should be happening in.

**WARNING:**  This code is going to throw an exception initially -  there are some things missing.  
Your mission is to find and fix those items! 

You can find an example of what the output might be like in 
`expected_output.txt`.
